#!	As explained in the readme file before this one
#!	There are 4 directories, 3 with source code
#!	and one (run) directory which can be used to run 
#!	jobs. 
#!	To compile the codes go into each directory and 
#!	follow the instructions in the text file. 
#! 	A sample script that compiles with gfortran has
#!	been provided for the basis set and main program
#!	This uses the gfortran compiler
#!	The latest version of the gfortran compiler is 
#!	recommended for this software
