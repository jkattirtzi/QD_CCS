#!	Unlike the other programs it is recommended
#! 	to run the program in the runbs directory here
#!	and not in the run directory above
#!      This keeps the files organised.
#!	The basisset.dat file should be copied into the
#!	run directory from which the main program can be run
#!	Information on running the basis set program is 
#!	found in the text file located in the runbs 
#!	directory.
