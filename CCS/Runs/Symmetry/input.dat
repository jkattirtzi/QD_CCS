# ! Type number of dimensions
ndim 1
# ! Give the value of hbar to define the units
hbar 1.0d0
# ! Number of basis functions 
nbf 12
# determines whether the basis set is symmetrical
sym YES
# The gamma for each degree of freedom
# syntax is :
# word(gamma) (degree number) gamma(value)
# e.g:
# if you have more than one degree of freedom put it directly below the first
gamma 1 1.0d0
#gamma 2 1.0d0
#gamma 3 1.0
mass 1 1.0d0
#mass 2 1.0d0
#mass 3 3.0d0
wfreq 1 1.0d0
#wfreq 2 1.0d0
#wfreq 3 2.5d0
#
# The syntax for mass would be the same as that for the gamma
# Seed value for doing the random number routine- if you do not specify it will automatically generate one
SEED 20
# output unit value, where to print the seed, this needs work and changing after output section written
outp 130
# mean for p -one for each degree of freedom is needed with the same syntax as mass and gamma
meanp 1 0.0d0
#meanp 2 0.0d0
#meanp 3 3.3
# mean for q - like mean for p
meanq 1 4.472135955d0
#meanq 2 0.0d0
#meanq 3 3.3
#give standard deviations for p and q, called sigma, this gives a spread for the randgen, one needed in total for each
sigp 1.0d0
sigq 1.00d0
# end of input- i'm not sure why but without this final comment get an error reading in sigq
